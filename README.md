# messaging-app

This is a website that lets you add friends and send them messages. With emphasis on clean, reusable code and a tidy file structure.

* The classes are simply the classes that exist due to me using OOP.
* The client files are going to be what the user predominantly interacts with and will mostly handle displaying input and output.
* The server files handle all the back end data transactions and follow the ACID rules (hopefully).
* The libraries are for external libraries I feel like I need to use to get my project working
